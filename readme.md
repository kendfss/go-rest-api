This is a simple rest api with hot-reloading for testing/development purposes. It also serves as a model for a musical archive which corresponds to a "seasonal" release schedule as opposed to the conventional "single"/"ep"/"album" increments. 
The hot reloader is powered by a make-file which invokes [my fork](https://github.com/kendfss/watcher) of [RadovskyB](https://github.com/radovskyb)'s Watcher program.
The api uses Gorilla's [multiplexer](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) to route and dispatch http requests.
